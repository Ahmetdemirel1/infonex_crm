TODO: 30) Add autocomplete to industry for crm/new.html and crm/detail.html

TODO: 8) (BIG) rework territory stuff

         - Best Idea is to make templates dynamic with cookie determining what's shown
         a) Need to update sidebar to dynamically reflect whether working on a conference - STARTED
         b) Need to (re)-create page showing all people in territory - territory.html - STARTED
         c) Need to update detail.html to show dynamic content based on whether working a conference
         d) Need to create a page for db admin to add a conference (recycle existing?)
         e) COMPLETED: Need to create a page for db admin to add people to a conference - manage_territory.html
         f) Need to (re)-create a page to create territory based on set criteria - manage_territory.html - STARTED
         g) Figure out JS for modal pop-up when destroying personalization
         h) Flesh out crm/views.py/sample_territory_list

TODO: 23) If territory exists: new person should pre-populate categorization with relevant details
          (This means updating crm.new.py)

          - Try to replicate the way Day One tags work

TODO: 28) if no admin access, set error page for accessing admin page

Long-term/iffy stuff:
1) register.index - consider reg button beside names (not hidden) - unsure
3) Personal notes??  I think everything should be open
